The project emphasized collaboration and agile methodologies to achieve sprint goals efficiently.

## Key Features

- **Film Filtering**: Implemented functionality to categorize films by genre, year, and other criteria, enhancing user navigation.
- **Data Generation**: Generated film data through a local mySQL environment to populate the website dynamically.
- **Prototyping**: Created interactive prototypes (including breadcrumbs, gallery view, and search bar) using HTML and CSS, facilitating a smooth transition to the local machine.
- **UI Design**: Designed wireframes and hi-fidelity mock-ups to ensure a user-friendly interface, followed by code refactoring for easier navigation.
- **Team Leadership**: Directed a team of five members, utilizing Agile methodologies to meet sprint goals, develop personas, and create UML diagrams.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the website.
- **Java**: For backend development and functionality.
- **mySQL**: For managing and querying the film database.
- **Eclipse**: For integrated development environment (IDE).
- **Flying Donut, CATME**: For team management and collaboration.
