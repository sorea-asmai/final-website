## Overview

The "Momento" project involved the creation of a Figma prototype aimed at monitoring and enhancing cognitive skills through user satisfaction for senior citizens. The objective was to design an accessible, user-centric experience that supports users in tracking their cognitive health while ensuring inclusivity and engagement.

## Key Features

- **User-Centric Design**: Comprehensive user research was conducted to identify key cognitive skills to monitor, leading to the development of intuitive interfaces based on feedback from senior citizens.
- **Figma Prototype**: Developed and implemented a fully interactive prototype using Figma, allowing stakeholders to visualize and interact with the design before implementation.
- **Accessibility Focus**: Ensured user accessibility and inclusivity by conducting interviews with a target audience of 4, resulting in a user-centric approach that addressed the specific needs and preferences of individuals aged 70. Accessibility best practices were applied to ensure usability for individuals with varying abilities, including features like adjustable text sizes and high-contrast color schemes.
- **Collaboration and Team Management**: Managed a team of 7 designers throughout the design research process, including prototypes, heuristic evaluations, and interviews, ensuring timely delivery of high-quality designs and contributing to a mock gamified application.

## Technologies Used

- **Figma**: Utilized for prototyping and design collaboration.
- **User Research Tools**: Used to gather insights and feedback from senior citizens to inform design decisions.

## Challenges and Learnings

Maintaining simplicity while incorporating a wide range of cognitive monitoring features posed a key challenge, requiring a balance between functionality and ease of use. Additionally, leading a diverse team introduced valuable lessons in leadership and collaboration.

## Outcome

The "Momento" prototype successfully addressed the cognitive health needs of senior citizens. It received positive feedback from stakeholders and users, underscoring its potential for real-world application in health monitoring. The project highlighted the importance of user research and collaboration in creating effective, accessible user experiences.
