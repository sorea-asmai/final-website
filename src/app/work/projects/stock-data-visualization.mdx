## Overview

Developed a Tableau-based data visualization to analyze weekly stock performance and average stock volume for Apple and Intel. The use of color differentiation enhances clarity, allowing for a clear comparison between the two companies. The volume display on the y-axis reveals recurring trends and their impact on weekly performance.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Created log-scaled line charts with interactive guide lines and price labels to facilitate real-time data exploration.
- **Yearly Average Analysis**: Designed a separate Tableau visualization to present yearly average stock volume, offering a broader perspective on market trends and their implications.
- **Zoomable and Scrollable Plots**: Implemented zoomable plots that allow users to hover for additional information, enhancing data interactivity and comprehension.

## Technologies Used

- **Tableau**: For data visualization and analysis.
- **ObservableHQ**: For building sophisticated interactive visualizations.

## Challenges and Learnings

Choosing the right data for visualization was challenging, as it needed to support interactivity. It required careful consideration of how to organize and display data effectively. Debugging and fine-tuning visual elements, such as color schemes, also took significant time.

## Outcome

The project resulted in effective visualizations that facilitate understanding of stock performance trends and trading volumes, contributing valuable insights for stakeholders.
