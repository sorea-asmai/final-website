## Overview

HerStart was created during Lovelace Hacks, the first women-focused hackathon from UC Davis. This project aims to provide career-growth opportunities for women and gender minorities in the technology industry. Inspired by the book *Lean In* by Sheryl Sandberg, it addresses the challenge of finding mentorship for women in tech. Our solution connects mentees with mentors, offering guidance and support from a female perspective.

## Key Features

- **Mentorship Connections**: The platform facilitates connections between mentees and mentors, fostering career growth and providing resources tailored to the needs of women and gender minorities.
- **User-Friendly Registration**: Users can easily register and specify their career interests, helping to match them with suitable mentors.
- **Resource Hub**: A dedicated section offers valuable insights and resources for navigating the tech industry from a female perspective.
- **Multimedia Platform**: Produced a multimedia platform connecting women and gender minorities entering the tech industry.
- **Seamless User Experience**: Utilized JavaScript on the front end to deliver a seamless user experience, and HTML/CSS for styling.
- **User Accessibility**: Prioritized user accessibility and usability based on the implementation of feedback.

## Challenges and Learnings

We faced several challenges with CodeSandbox.io, including software issues that led to code loss and difficulties in syncing changes with our GitHub account. Additionally, not all team members were familiar with the necessary coding languages and tools. We learned the importance of effective communication and collaboration, as well as the value of thorough planning and wireframing before diving into coding.

## Outcome

Despite the challenges, we successfully created an engaging platform that serves as a crucial resource for female empowerment in the tech industry. The project has laid the groundwork for expanding mentorship opportunities and fostering a supportive community for women and gender minorities.
